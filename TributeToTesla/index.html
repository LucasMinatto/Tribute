      <h2>Here's a little about Nikola's life:</h2>

<p><strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia) on July 10. His father was a priest, and his mother, though unschooled, was a talented inventor of household devices.</p>
<p><strong>1870s</strong> - Studies engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz and later at Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague. Leaves university before graduating.</p>
<p><strong>1881</strong> - Works in Budapest, Hungary, where he conceives the idea for the rotating magnetic field, a fundamental principle of his later inventions.</p>
<p><strong>1882</strong> - Moves to Paris to work for the Continental Edison Company, designing and improving electrical equipment.</p>
<p><strong>1884</strong> - Emigrates to the United States. Begins working with Thomas Edison in New York but resigns due to conflicting ideas and business disagreements.</p>
<p><strong>1885</strong> - Secures funding for the Tesla Electric Light Company but is forced out of the business. Left digging ditches to make ends meet, he vows to continue his research.</p>
<p><strong>1887</strong> - Develops the induction motor and begins promoting alternating current (AC), which becomes a cornerstone of modern electricity.</p>
<p><strong>1888</strong> - Partners with George Westinghouse to commercialize AC. This alliance sparks the “War of the Currents” with Edison, who advocates for direct current (DC).</p>
<p><strong>1891</strong> - Invents the Tesla coil, which becomes essential in wireless communication and experiments with high-voltage electricity. Becomes a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p><strong>1893</strong> - Plays a crucial role in lighting the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, showcasing the superiority of AC over DC.</p>
<p><strong>1895</strong> - Builds one of the world's first hydroelectric power plants at Niagara Falls, in collaboration with Westinghouse.</p>
<p><strong>1898</strong> - Demonstrates a radio-controlled boat, an early step toward wireless technology and remote control systems.</p>
<p><strong>1900</strong> - Begins work on the Wardenclyffe Tower, a massive project aimed at providing wireless global communication and free energy. The project is abandoned due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>1917</strong> - Receives the Edison Medal, the highest honor from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, for his contributions to the development of electricity.</p>
<p><strong>1920s–1930s</strong> - Lives in relative obscurity, though he continues to propose radical ideas, including plans for wireless energy transmission and advanced weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>1943</strong> - Dies alone on January 7 in a New York City hotel room at the age of 86. Later that year, the U.S. Supreme Court credits him posthumously for the invention of the radio.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Tesla's work laid the foundation for countless technologies, including modern power systems, wireless communication, and robotics. Often underappreciated in his lifetime, he is now celebrated as one of history's greatest inventors, a visionary who dreamed far beyond the limits of his era.</p>
